As my first post to kick off the page, I would like to leave a raw document I made up learning
the signal path from coax to my terminal. I am posting in hopes that someone curious about the
same ideas has a starting point. If you feel any information is innaccurate I would love to know
which information so I can add/correct it. Cheers.
